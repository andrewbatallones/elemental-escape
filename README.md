# Elemental Escape

This will be an attempt at a 2D platformer game that will dive more into Unity and other features that I haven't touched on when building the Asteroids game. This will be more of an action-ish type of game, like Spelunky or Battle Kid. This time around, I have done a little bit of preplanning, which can be found here. As the project progresses, I will also edit this README to reflect (that's the hope at least). Hopefully there will be progress!

### Story???
A cave that will transport the player deeper and deeper and they will have to beat bosses to open the last door to escape.
You will start off locked in a cave, then in a temple, with your only companion a strange looking block person. Get the keys from each cooridor to unlock the door and get out. You are equipped with a spell book.

### Features
- Platformer
- Dialogue system
- Lighting
- Enemy's with a more complex AI (well, more complex than floating rocks...)
- (Maybe if time and motivation permites) Creating my own music

### Bosses and Enemies.
The enemies and bosses will follow a theme (element)
- fire
- ice
- earth
- light
- dark
